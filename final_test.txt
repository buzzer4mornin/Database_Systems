Relational Schema Design 

Selecting classes connected with M:N and 1:N --> Manufacture, Vehicle, Distributor

	1. Insert into universal relation table
	
		NOTE: Manufacture and Distributor both have attribute "name". Because this can cause confusion, we are changing Manufacture.name -> mname and 			Distributor.name -> dname
		
		Preaparing Universal relation:
		(vehicleID, model, year_made, price, manufactureID, mname, country, city, average_yearly_capacity,distributorID, dname, 				        average_monthly_distribution_count)


	2.  Add functional dependencies
	
		Definition: Functional dependency is relationship that exists when one at-tribute (or group) uniquely determines another attribute (or group)
		X -> Y means Y is functionally dependent on X , or we say X  uniquely determines Y  
		
		Adding Functional Dependencies: 
		vehicleID ==> model, year_made, price, manufactureID   [ primary key determines everything ]
		model, year_made ==> price                             [ given model and year_made we can uniquely identify vehicle's price ]
		model ==> mname                                        [ given model we can uniquely identify vehicle's manufacturer name ]
		model, year_made ==> mname                             [ Just adding some Redundant FDs! Will be proved and removed later]
		
		manufactureID ==> mname, country, city, average_yearly_capacity   [ primary key determines everything]
		mname ==> manufactureID                                           [ unique column determine the key ]
		city ==> country                                                  [ given city, we can uniquely identify manufacture's country ]
		mname,city ==> average_yearly_capacity                            [ Just adding some Redundant FDs! Will be proved and removed later]
		mname,country,city ==> average_yearly_capacity                    [ Just adding some Redundant FDs! Will be proved and removed later]
 
 
		distributorID ==> dname, average_monthly_distribution_count      [ primary key determines everything]
		dname  ==> distributorID                                         [ unique column determine the key ]  
		dname ==> average_monthly_distribution_count                     [ Just adding some Redundant FDs! Will be proved and removed later]


		
	3.  Minimal Cover
	
		Steps/

		Rewrite the Functional Dependencies into those with only one attribute on RHS:
		vehicleID            ==>   model
		vehicleID            ==>   year_made
		vehicleID            ==>   price
		vehicleID            ==>   manufactureID
		model,year_made      ==>   price
		model                ==>   mname
		model, year_made     ==>   mname                                                            
		manufactureID        ==>   mname
		manufactureID        ==>   country
		manufactureID        ==>   city
		manufactureID        ==>   average_yearly_capacity
		mname                ==>   manufactureID
		city                 ==>   country
		mname, city          ==>   average_yearly_capacity                             
		mname, country, city ==>   average_yearly_capacity                             
		distributorID        ==>   dname
		distributorID        ==>   average_monthly_distribution_count
		dname                ==>   distributorID
		dname                ==>   average_monthly_distribution_count       
		
		
	
	4.   Remove trivial Functional Dependencies (those where the RHS is also in the LHS):
		vehicleID             ==>   model
		vehicleID             ==>   year_made
		vehicleID             ==>   price
		vehicleID             ==>   manufactureID
		model,year_made       ==>   price
		model                 ==>   mname
		model, year_made      ==>   mname                                                            
		manufactureID         ==>   mname
		manufactureID         ==>   country
		manufactureID         ==>   city
		manufactureID         ==>   average_yearly_capacity
		mname                 ==>   manufactureID
		city                  ==>   country
		mname, city           ==>   average_yearly_capacity                             
		mname, country, city  ==>   average_yearly_capacity                             
		distributorID         ==>   dname
		distributorID         ==>   average_monthly_distribution_count
		dname                 ==>   distributorID
		dname                 ==>   average_monthly_distribution_count       
		NOTHING IS REMOVED!



	5.   Remove Redundant Attributes by minimizing LHS of each Functional Dependency:
		vehicleID        ==>   model
		vehicleID        ==>   year_made
		vehicleID        ==>   price
		vehicleID        ==>   manufactureID
		model,year_made  ==>   price                                                               
		model            ==>   mname
		model            ==>   mname    {year_made} was Redundant At-tribute       
		manufactureID    ==>   mname
		manufactureID    ==>   country
		manufactureID    ==>   city
		manufactureID    ==>   average_yearly_capacity
		mname            ==>   manufactureID
		city             ==>   country
		mname            ==>   average_yearly_capacity   {city} was Re-dundant  Attribute  
		mname            ==>   average_yearly_capacity   {country, city} was Redundant Attribute
		distributorID    ==>   dname
