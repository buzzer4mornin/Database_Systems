Relational Schema Design 

Selecting classes connected with M:N and 1:N --> Manufacture, Vehicle, Distributor

	1. Insert into universal relation table
	
		NOTE: Manufacture and Distributor both have attribute "name". Because this can cause confusion, we are changing Manufacture.name -> mname and 			Distributor.name -> dname
		
		Preaparing Universal relation:
		(vehicleID, model, year_made, price, manufactureID, mname, country, city, average_yearly_capacity,distributorID, dname, 				        average_monthly_distribution_count)


	2.  Add functional dependencies
	
		Definition: Functional dependency is relationship that exists when one at-tribute (or group) uniquely determines another attribute (or group)
		X -> Y means Y is functionally dependent on X , or we say X  uniquely determines Y  
		
		Adding Functional Dependencies: 
		vehicleID ==> model, year_made, price, manufactureID   [ primary key determines everything ]
		model, year_made ==> price                             [ given model and year_made we can uniquely identify vehicle's price ]
		model ==> mname                                        [ given model we can uniquely identify vehicle's manufacturer name ]
		model, year_made ==> mname                             [ Just adding some Redundant FDs! Will be proved and removed later]
		
		manufactureID ==> mname, country, city, average_yearly_capacity   [ primary key determines everything]
		mname ==> manufactureID                                           [ unique column determine the key ]
		city ==> country                                                  [ given city, we can uniquely identify manufacture's country ]
		mname,city ==> average_yearly_capacity                            [ Just adding some Redundant FDs! Will be proved and removed later]
		mname,country,city ==> average_yearly_capacity                    [ Just adding some Redundant FDs! Will be proved and removed later]
 
 
		distributorID ==> dname, average_monthly_distribution_count      [ primary key determines everything]
		dname  ==> distributorID                                         [ unique column determine the key ]  
		dname ==> average_monthly_distribution_count                     [ Just adding some Redundant FDs! Will be proved and removed later]
